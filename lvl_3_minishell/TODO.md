TODO 

 * PARSER

 * handle quotes and dquotes, parsing should recognize that the text between
	dquotes is only 1 argument and trim them

 * ls -la |      must wait for input, for the user to provide the right
				 side of the pipe

 * Trying to access an user-defined-env_variable is segfaulting
	E.g echo $USER or echo $4
